In short terms:
It's an automatic cat-feeder which is modular build. The wiring need's to be done by yourself. 
I used an D1 ESP8266 and ESPHOME to integrate them into home-assistant which works flawlessly. 
So far we had no failures besides the lid-gasket sometimes sticking to the bowl. 
Normally this detaches by itself through the force of the spring after some seconds.

We use a sound-file at feeding-time (automated with HA) so the cat's know that the food is ready. They just start to run like crazy if they hear it.
